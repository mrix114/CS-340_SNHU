### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I think keeping the single responsibility principle is key to writing code that is maintainable, reusable, and adaptable. The advantage of using this principle is that all of the operational needs can be employed separately with individualized modules for each of the CRUD operations. I think adding in the ability to update a selection from the dataset would be useful and could be relatively easily employed using the update module. 

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach troubleshooting in much the same way as I did when I was a mechanical technician and an electrical technician. I start big and eliminate sources of error. This does require that I have a high-level understanding of the projects architecture and how it all works together. Planning when it comes to building something however is very different. I have become a big fan of UML diagrams that allow me to visualize all the functions and connections I need for a project.  

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

In my view computer scientist, programmers, and data analystsâ€™ primary purpose is to rapidly and efficiently deliver useful information to help people make decisions. The customer who is making the decision and the type of decision may vary but this is the overall goal.
